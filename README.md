# XL Device Wall
Engineers at XtremeLabs came up with an idea on how to use multiple devices in an orchestra to create a unique experience. With so many people interested in contributing to this idea, we had a hackathon where we had engineers work in groups, contributing on all the separate pieces needed to make this happen. This is a repository of projects involved. 

##How To Start Using
This will describe how someone could potentially recreate our wall.

##Projects 

### Android AMQP Services 
[/android/DeviceWallService](https://github.com/xtremelabs/xl-device_wall-suite/tree/master/android/DeviceWallService)
(Need this running on the device to ensure that the client can connect)

### Android AMQP Client Libraries 
[/android/DeviceWallShared](https://github.com/xtremelabs/xl-device_wall-suite/tree/master/android/DeviceWallShared)
(Use this to connect to the AMQP Service and server)

### Java Models and Constants 
[/java/DeviceWallModels](https://github.com/xtremelabs/xl-device_wall-suite/tree/master/java/DeviceWallModels)
(This is used by almost all the java applications)

### Device Wall Programs 
[/java/DeviceWallPrograms](https://github.com/xtremelabs/xl-device_wall-suite/tree/master/java/DeviceWallPrograms)
(Server Clients that run the logic for the unified experience)

### Video Game
[/android/DeviceWallMarbleRun](https://github.com/xtremelabs/xl-device_wall-suite/tree/master/android/DeviceWallMarbleRun)
(This application didn't get to implementing AMQP but is on its way to play a unified experience gravity game)

### Card Game
[/android/DeviceWallMemoryGame](https://github.com/xtremelabs/xl-device_wall-suite/tree/master/android/DeviceWallMemoryGame)
(This is the Memory game that everyone got a chance to experience)
