This application takes a picture of devices all running the [identifier application](https://github.com/xtremelabs/xl-device_wall-suite/tree/master/android/DeviceWallPrototype)
and turns the picture into rectangles in json form. This data feeds into the [image application](https://github.com/xtremelabs/xl-device_wall-suite/tree/master/android/DeviceWallImageApp)
which makes it possible to split up an image across the screens keeping in mind each screen's position.
